            <h2>1. Overview</h2>
            <p>
                DealSpot is a Shop Mini that runs inside the Shopify Shop app. We help you discover products through curated sections (Trending, Recommended, Recent, and Saved) and provide filtering tools to refine your search. We rely on the Shop Minis SDK for all user interactions, storage, and checkout.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>2. Data We Display</h2>
            <p>Everything you see inside DealSpot comes directly from Shopify:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Product catalog details, pricing, and discounts supplied by merchants.</li>
                <li>Product rankings, ratings, and review data available through the Shop Minis API.</li>
                <li>Merchant profiles, shop information, and fulfillment metadata owned by Shopify.</li>
                <li>Your recent browsing history and saved products (stored locally via Shop Minis SDK).</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>3. Data We Collect</h2>
            <p>We only collect lightweight, anonymous information to keep the mini running smoothly:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Basic usage analytics such as which sections you visit and products you view.</li>
                <li>Filter preferences you set (stored locally via Shop Minis SDK).</li>
                <li>Performance data provided by the Shop Minis SDK (for example, screen load timing).</li>
                <li>Crash or error details reported through Shopify's diagnostic tools.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We do <strong>not</strong> receive personal identifiers (email, address, payment info) from Shopify.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>4. How We Use This Data</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Display your personalized product recommendations and browsing history.</li>
                <li>Remember your filter preferences to improve your browsing experience.</li>
                <li>Measure which product discovery features work best on mobile devices.</li>
                <li>Monitor reliability so that experiences stay fast and responsive.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>5. Storage & Security</h2>
            <p>
                All data flows through Shopify’s infrastructure. We rely on the Shop Minis SDK for storage, secure communication, and authentication. We do not export or store data outside Shopify systems.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>6. Data Retention</h2>
            <p>
                Anonymous analytics logs are kept only as long as Shopify retains them for operational purposes. If Shopify deletes your Shop account or clears activity data, DealSpot automatically loses access as well.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>7. Your Choices</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Manage data sharing preferences inside the Shop app privacy settings.</li>
                <li>Clear the Shop app’s local data to remove cached DealSpot activity.</li>
                <li>Stop using DealSpot at any time—no information is kept after the Shop app removes it.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>8. Changes to This Policy</h2>
            <p>
                If we update how DealSpot handles information, we will refresh this page and revise the “Last updated” date. Keep using DealSpot only if you agree with the latest policy.
            </p>

        <section>
            <h2>9. Questions</h2>
            <p>
                Need help? Open the Shop app, go to <em>Account → Help & support</em>, and reference the DealSpot mini. Shopify will route questions to us if needed.
