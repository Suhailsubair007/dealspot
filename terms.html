        <section>
            <h2>1. Acceptance</h2>
            <p>
                DealSpot is a Shop Mini that runs entirely inside the Shopify Shop app. By opening or using DealSpot you agree to these Terms and to the Shopify Shop app Terms of Service. Do not use DealSpot if you disagree.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>2. What DealSpot Does</h2>
            <p>
                DealSpot helps you discover products through four curated sections: Trending Spot (popular products), Recommended Spot (personalized picks), Recent Spot (your browsing history), and Saved Spot (your favorites). You can filter products by shop, price range, rating, and sale status. All product data comes from Shopify and participating stores. Checkout, payments, and fulfillment happen entirely within Shopify's systems.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>3. Eligibility</h2>
            <p>
                You must be able to form a binding contract and meet the eligibility requirements of the Shopify Shop app. If Shopify suspends your Shop account you automatically lose access to DealSpot.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>4. Your Responsibilities</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Use DealSpot only for lawful shopping activity.</li>
                <li>Follow merchant policies for returns, shipping, and support.</li>
                <li>Keep your Shopify credentials secure—DealSpot never asks for them directly.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>5. Product & Pricing Information</h2>
            <p>
                Prices, availability, inventory, and promotions are controlled by merchants and may change without notice. We show the most recent data Shopify provides, but we cannot promise that every listing or badge is error-free.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>6. Purchases</h2>
            <p>
                All payments, order processing, and fulfillment happen through Shopify’s systems. DealSpot never collects payment information and is not the seller of record. Disputes or returns must be handled with the merchant via the Shop app.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>7. Prohibited Use</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>No scraping, reverse engineering, or attempting to bypass Shopify safeguards.</li>
                <li>No automated use cases that could degrade performance of the Shop app.</li>
                <li>No fraudulent orders, reviews, or discount abuse.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>8. Intellectual Property</h2>
            <p>
                The DealSpot name, UI, and curated collections are our property. Product images, marks, and descriptions remain the property of each merchant or Shopify. You may not reuse assets outside the Shop app.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>9. Disclaimers & Liability</h2>
            <p>
                DealSpot is provided “as is.” We do not guarantee uninterrupted availability, error-free pricing, or specific savings. To the extent permitted by law we are not liable for indirect, incidental, or consequential damages.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>10. Suspension or Termination</h2>
            <p>
                We can suspend or remove access to DealSpot if you violate these Terms or if Shopify requests it. You may stop using DealSpot at any time by closing the mini.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>11. Changes to These Terms</h2>
            <p>
                We may change these Terms to reflect new features or Shopify policies. Updates become effective once posted here. Continuing to use DealSpot means you accept the revised Terms.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>12. Getting Help</h2>
            <p>
                For questions about DealSpot open the Shop app, navigate to <em>Account → Help & support</em>, and mention this mini. Shopify will route messages to us if something needs our attention.
